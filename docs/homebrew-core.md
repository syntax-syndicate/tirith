## Requirements

Homebrew core requires "notable" projects. Indicators include:
- 30+ GitHub stars

## Formula Differences

The homebrew-core formula differs from our tap:

2. Fork homebrew/homebrew-core
3. Create formula at `Formula/t/tirith.rb`
4. Submit PR with description of what tirith does
5. Address reviewer feedback
